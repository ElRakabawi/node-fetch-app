# Node fetch app documentation
This guide is dissected into three parts:
* How to install/run the app
* File structure 
* How it's built?



### How to install/run the app?
##### Installing nodejs and npm
1) The app is built on Node.jS, so to be able to run it you must have Node.JS and NPM. If you already have it on your system proceed to step(3).
2) Visit [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), then download your OS installer and run it.
3) Now you should have both NodeJS and NPM installed on your system, give them a little check by checking their presence and version in terminal/command-prompt:
  ```bash
  elrakabawi$ node -v
  #returns your nodejs version as: v6.9.0
  elrakabawi$ npm -v
  #returns your npm version as: 3.10.8
  ```
  ##### Installing and running our app
  4) Now acces the app directory you've downloaded from this repository with your terminal. You will find a File structure like [this](https://github.com/ElRakabawi/node-fetch-app/readme/).
